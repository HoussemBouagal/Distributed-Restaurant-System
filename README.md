# 🍽️ Restaurant Ordering System - Java RMI

This project is a distributed system implemented in Java using **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**. It simulates a restaurant management application where clients can view restaurant information, browse menus, place orders, and view delivery options.

## ✅ Functionalities

- ✅ View a list of available restaurants (handled by `Server1`)
- ✅ View detailed menu for each restaurant (handled by `Server2`)
- ✅ Place food orders with client details (handled by `Server3`)
- ✅ Check available delivery options (handled by `Server3`)
- ✅ Store order and feedback information into local text files

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- RMI Registry (`rmiregistry`)
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ) or terminal

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Compile all source files

```bash
javac rmiinterface/*.java rmiserver/*.java
```

> Add `rmiclient/*.java` if you have a GUI.

---

### 2. Start the RMI Registry

```bash
start rmiregistry
```

Or (on Linux/macOS):

```bash
rmiregistry &
```

Keep this terminal window open.

---

### 3. Start the Servers

In separate terminals or sequentially:

```bash
java rmiserver.Server1
java rmiserver.Server2
java rmiserver.Server3
```

---

### 4. Run the Client (optional)

```bash
java rmiclient.Client
```

Make sure it connects to the correct servers.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The servers simulate real-world distribution by handling different concerns:
  - **Server1**: Restaurant details
  - **Server2**: Menu details
  - **Server3**: Orders, delivery, and feedback
